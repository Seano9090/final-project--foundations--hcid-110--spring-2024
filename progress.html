          <p>The first part of development was deciding which libraries to use in order to help support this idea. After debating through many libraries, I settled with face_recognition and opencv. I used an easy-to-understand language for this Python, making it user-friendly for beginner programmers to understand. I than made a flow chart which allowed me to visual the process of the application.</p>

            <h3>face_recognition library:</h3>
            <p>The face_recognition library is a powerful and simple tool for facial recognition tasks. It provides easy-to-use functions for detecting faces in images, comparing faces, and extracting facial features. With just a few lines of code, you can perform tasks like identifying faces, comparing face encodings, and even recognizing known individuals.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>opencv library:</h3>
            <p>OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a widely used library for computer vision and image processing. It provides a comprehensive set of functions and algorithms for tasks such as image and video analysis, object detection, facial recognition, and more. OpenCV offers a wide range of tools and capabilities that make it a valuable resource for computer vision projects.</p>
